        "\nPython dictionaries are a commonly used data structure.  They make many tasks easier, including counting how many times a value occurs in a list.  For example, let's say we want to find out how many apps in the app store have different age ratings.  Age ratings tell us which ages an app is appropriate for.\nWe'll do the full counting procedure later, but we'll start with a simpler version.  We can create a dictionary that has the age ratings as keys, and the app counts as values.\n\n```python\ncontent_ratings = {'4+': 4433, '9+': 987, '12+': 1155, '17+': 622}\n```\n\nAs you can see, our dictionary has `4` keys, and $4433 + 987 + 1155 + 622 = 7197$ values.\n\n"

We can check if the value `'12+'` exists as a key in the dictionary using the `in` operator.\n\n```python\nprint('12+' in content_ratings)\n```\nThe `'12+' in content_ratings` expression returned the Boolean `True`. This is because the string `'12+'` exists in the dictionary `content_ratings` as a key.  If we use `in` with a value that doesn't exist among a dictionary's keys, we'll get `False`. \n\n"

Not wanting to be left behind, the English sent explorers to North America. One example was John Cabot, who made landfall around Newfoundland in 1497.\nThe first British colony was established by Walter Raleigh at Roanoke Island, Virginia, in 1585. About 600 male colonists were sent, but due to a lack of provisions, only 108 stayed.\nLike most early English colonists, they were unprepared for survival in the New World.

This was exacerbated by the actions of the English - including kidnapping tribe members and burning a village.\nThe English were eventually forced to evacuate the Roanoke colony and return to England.\n\nRaleigh made a second attempt in 1587 with 115 colonists, including two Native Americans who went back to England with the original expedition - Manteo and Towaye. Manteo smoothed over relations with Native American tribes in the area.\nAn English expedition did not return to Roanoke until 1590. They found that the village was abandoned, and the the word 'CROATOAN' was carved on a tree.\nThe expedition did not find the colonists, but assumed that they had relocated to Croatoan Island.\nRaleigh only mounted token efforts to find the colonists, because their fate being undecided meant that he could still claim the Virginia colony.\nOther efforts were made to find the colonists, but their fate has never been discovered.\n\n"
