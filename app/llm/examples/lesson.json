A pair of braces creates an empty dictionary: {}. Placing a comma-separated list of key:value pairs within the braces adds initial key:value pairs to the dictionary; this is also the way dictionaries are written on output.\n```",

Dictionaries can be created using braces `{}`, with comma-separated keys and values inside.\n\nHere we create a dictionary that has age ratings as keys, and the number of movies that fall into that age range as values.\n\n```python\ncontent_ratings = {'4+': 4433, '9+': 987, '12+': 1155, '17+': 622}\n```\n\nOur dictionary has `4` keys, and `4` values. The sum of the values is $4433 + 987 + 1155 + 622 = 7197$.\n\nWe can check if a value like `'12+'` exists as a key in the dictionary using the `in` operator.\n\n```python\nprint('12+' in content_ratings)\n```\nThe `'12+' in content_ratings` expression returned the Boolean `True`. This is because the string `'12+'` exists in the dictionary `content_ratings` as a key.  If we use `in` with a value that doesn't exist among a dictionary's keys, we'll get `False`. \n\n"
