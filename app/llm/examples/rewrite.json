In a simple random walk, the location can only jump to neighboring sites of the lattice, forming a lattice path. In a simple symmetric random walk on a locally finite lattice, the probabilities of the location jumping to each one of its immediate neighbors are the same.\n```\n* ```\nA stochastic process {Xn}n∈N0 is called a simple random walk if\n1. X0 = 0,\n2. the increment Xn+1 − Xn is independent of (X0, X1, . . . , Xn) for each n ∈ N0, and\n3. the increment Xn+1 − Xn has the coin-toss distribution, i.e.\nP[Xn+1 − Xn = 1] = P[Xn+1 − Xn = −1] = 1\n2 .\nFor the sequence {γn}n∈N, given by Theorem 3.2, define the following, new, sequence {ξn}n∈N\nof random variables:\nξn =\n{\n1, γn ≥ 1\n2\n−1, otherwise.\nThen, we set\nX0 = 0, Xn =\nn∑\nk=1\nξk, n ∈ N.\nIntuitively, we use each ξn to emulate a coin toss and then define the value of the process X at\ntime n as the cumulative sum of the first n coin-tosses.\n```",

Let ρxy = Px[Ty < ∞] be the\nprobability that the walk starting at x ever gets to y at some future time.\nFirst we show that ρ12 = 1. This says that in the fair game one is almost\nsure to eventually get ahead by one unit. This follows from the following three\nequations.\nThe first equation says that in the first step the walk either goes from 1 to\n2 directly, or it goes from 1 to 0 and then must go from 0 to 2. Thus\nρ12 = 1\n2 + 1\n2ρ02.\n(1.2)\nThe second equation says that to go from 0 to 2, the walk has to go from\n0 to 1 and then from 1 to 2. Furthermore, these two events are independent.",
    "markdown": "### 1.1 Symmetric Simple Random Walk\n\nA random walk is a mathematical model describing a path of an object moving randomly in discrete time steps.\n\nConsider the symmetric simple random walk, where the object moves one step to the left or right with equal probability at each time step.\n\nThe position of the object at time $n$ is denoted by $X_n$. The position at time $n+1$ is given by\n$$X_{n+1} = X_n + \\xi_{n+1}$$\nwhere $\\xi_{n+1}$ are independent, identically distributed random variables with $P[\\xi_{n+1} = \\pm1] = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe concept of *hitting time* is essential in understanding this random walk. Let $T_y$ be the first time $n \\geq 1$ when $X_n = y$. The hitting time represents the number of steps for the random walk to reach position $y$.\n\nOur focus is on the probability, $\\rho_{xy}$, that the random walk starting at position $x$ reaches position $y$ at a future time, defined as $\\rho_{xy} = P_x[T_y < \\infty]$.\n\nFor instance, to compute $\\rho_{12}$, the probability that a random walk starting at position 1 ever reaches position 2, we have:\n$$\\rho_{12} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\rho_{02} \\quad (1.1)$$\n\nThe rationale is that the walk can either go directly from 1 to 2 or traverse from 1 to 0 and then from 0 to 2.\n\nLikewise, to go from position 0 to 2, the walk may take a direct step from 0 to 1 or from 0 to -1 and subsequently from -1 to 1. This gives:\n$$\\rho_{02} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\rho_{-1,2} \\quad (1.2)$$\n\n### Example\n\nLet's compute the probability for a symmetric simple random walk beginning at position 0 to eventually reach position 2.\n\nStarting with $\\rho_{02}$:\n$$\\rho_{02} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\rho_{-1,2}$$\n\nNext, for $ \\rho_{-1,2}$:\n$$\\rho_{-1,2} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\rho_{-2,2}$$\n\nThis iterative method can be used to ascertain $\\rho_{02}$.\n\nFinally, substituting the obtained value of $\\rho_{02}$ into equation (1.1), we can discern the probability of reaching position 2 starting from position 0."
