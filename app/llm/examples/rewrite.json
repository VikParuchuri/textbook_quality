    "markdown": "## Random Walk\n\n### Symmetric Simple Random Walk\n\nConsider a random walk where the initial position is denoted by X0 = x and subsequent positions are given by the formula:\n\nXn+1 = Xn + ξn+1.   (1.1)\n\nHere, ξi are independent and identically distributed random variables with the property:\n\nP[ξi = ±1] = 1/2.\n\nThe probabilities for this random walk are also dependent on the initial position x, and we will denote them by Px. We can think of this random walk as a fair gambling game, where at each stage, one either wins or loses a fixed amount.\n\nLet Ty be the first time n ≥ 1 when Xn = y. We define ρxy as the probability that the random walk starting at x ever reaches the position y at some future time.\n\nFirst, we will show that ρ12 = 1. This means that in this fair game, one is almost certain to eventually get ahead by one unit. This can be proven using the following three equations.\n\nThe first equation states that in the first step, the random walk either goes directly from 1 to 2 or goes from 1 to 0 and then must go from 0 to 2. Thus,\n\nρ12 = 1/2 + 1/2 * ρ02.   (1.2)\n\nThe second equation states that to go from 0 to 2, the random walk must first go from 0 to 1 and then from 1 to 2. Furthermore, these two events are independent."
