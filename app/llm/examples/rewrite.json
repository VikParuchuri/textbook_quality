In a simple random walk, the location can only jump to neighboring sites of the lattice, forming a lattice path. In a simple symmetric random walk on a locally finite lattice, the probabilities of the location jumping to each one of its immediate neighbors are the same.\n```\n* ```\nA stochastic process {Xn}n∈N0 is called a simple random walk if\n1.

    "markdown": "### 1.1 Symmetric Simple Random Walk\nA random walk is a mathematical model that describes the path of a randomly moving object in discrete time steps. \n\nLet's start with the simplest form of a random walk, called the symmetric simple random walk. In this case, the object can only move one step to the left or one step to the right with equal probability at each time step. \n\nWe denote the current position of the object at time $n$ as $Xn$. The position at time $n+1$ is determined by adding an increment $ξn+1$ to the current position Xn. The increments ξn+1 are independent, identically distributed random variables, where P[ξn+1 = ±1] = 1/2.\n\nTo understand the behavior of the symmetric simple random walk, we introduce the concept of hitting time. Let Ty be the first time n ≥ 1 when Xn = y. The hitting time represents the number of steps it takes for the random walk to reach a specific position y.\n\nWe are interested in the probability that the random walk starting at position x ever reaches position y at some future time. We denote this probability as ρxy = Px[Ty < ∞].\n\nTo calculate ρxy, we can use a recursive approach. Let's consider the case where y = 1. We want to find ρ12, the probability that the random walk starting at position x ever reaches position 1.\n\nWe can break down the calculation of ρ12 into three equations:\n\n1. The first equation states that in the first step, the walk either goes directly from 1 to 2 or goes from 1 to 0 and then from 0 to 2. Therefore, we have:\n\n   ρ12 = 1/2 + 1/2 * ρ02.   (1.1)\n\n2. The second equation states that to go from 0 to 2, the walk must go from 0 to 1 and then from 1 to 2. Furthermore, these two events are independent.\n\n3. The third equation states that to go from 0 to 2, the walk must go from 0 to 1 and then from 1 to 2. Furthermore, these two events are independent.\n\nNow, let's solve these equations to find ρ12.\n\n```\nρ12 = 1/2 + 1/2 * ρ02\n```\n\nTo solve this equation, we need to find ρ02. We can use the same approach of breaking down the calculation into three equations:\n\n1. The first equation states that in the first step, the walk either goes directly from 0 to 1 or goes from 0 to -1 and then from -1 to 1. Therefore, we have:\n\n   ρ02 = 1/2 + 1/2 * ρ-12.   (1.2)\n\n2. The second equation states that to go from -1 to 1, the walk must go from -1 to 0 and then from 0 to 1. Furthermore, these two events are independent.\n\n3. The third equation states that to go from -1 to 1, the walk must go from -1 to 0 and then from 0 to 1. Furthermore, these two events are independent.\n\nBy solving these equations iteratively, we can find the value of ρ12.\n\n### Example\n\nLet's consider a symmetric simple random walk starting at position 0. We want to calculate the probability of reaching position 2 at some future time.\n\nUsing the recursive approach, we can calculate ρ02 as follows:\n\n```\nρ02 = 1/2 + 1/2 * ρ-12\n```\n\nTo find ρ-12, we repeat the process:\n\n```\nρ-12 = 1/2 + 1/2 * ρ-22\n```\n\nContinuing this process, we eventually find the value of ρ02.\n\nNow, let's substitute the value of ρ02 into the equation for ρ12:\n\n```\nρ12 = 1/2 + 1/2 * ρ02\n```\n\nBy solving this equation, we can determine the probability of reaching position 2 starting from position 0.\n\n"
