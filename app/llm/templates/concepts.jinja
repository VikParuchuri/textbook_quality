Think step by step to help develop a detailed textbook for a student.  Identify whether the topic of the textbook involves programming, if the topic is feasible for you to teach, and up to 5 high-level concepts that could be involved in the textbook.  Make the concepts as concrete as possible, but no more than 3 words each.  The response should be in JSON format.  Only respond with valid JSON.
