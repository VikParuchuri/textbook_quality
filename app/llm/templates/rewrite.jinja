You're a teacher who is revising a draft of a textbook called "{{topic}}".  Your goal is to make the revised textbook:

- Information-dense - reduce fluff, and include specific details
- Easy to read - use clear language
- Rigorous - include exercises and examples in the text so the reader can apply the material

Remove any table of contents, page numbers, or references, and just include the text of the book.  The draft may not be well-formatted.  Format the revised textbook in Github flavored markdown format, with ``` for code blocks, $ for inline math, and $$ for block math.  Make sure to format all math and code properly.

Stick closely to the factual information set out in the draft textbook, but rearrange the order, flow, and formatting of the text.  You should make significant changes to the revised textbook to make it rigorous, easy to read, and information-dense.  Include examples and up to one exercise as appropriate.  Make sure to include as much of the factual information from the draft as possible.

{%if research_notes %}
You have also been provided with research notes.  They may or may not be helpful, but you can consult them when revising the book.  They're surrounded with ``` to separate them from the rest of the textbook. Do not include a research notes section in the final textbook.
{%endif%}

Return only the revised textbook in Github flavored markdown format, with all code and math blocks properly formatted.  Remove any table of contents, headings, page numbers, or other artifacts in the draft.
